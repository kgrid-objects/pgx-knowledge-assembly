# PGx Knowledgebase (PGx-KB)

### What is the PGx-KB?

The PGx-KB is a prototype pharmacogenomics knowledgebase enabling general explorations into knowledgebase construction.

Its formal architecture is an example Knowledge Object (KO) of the **Knowledge Base (KB) type**.

By our working definition, a **Knowledge Base** is defined as a **distinct type** of KO that has one or more Knowledge Sets and one or more Purposes.

In keeping with this definition of a KB, the PGx-KB has the following three Knowledge Sets:

- Knowledge Set 1: A list of KOs with implementations of knowledge for mapping genotypes to pharmacogenomic (PGx) phenotypes based on CPIC guidelines.
- Knowledge Set 2: A list of KOs with implementations of knowledge for mapping PGx phenotypes to drug-specific recommendations based on CPIC guidelines.
- Knowledge Set 3: A list of KOs with implementations of knowledge for mapping PGx phenotypes to drug-specific recommendations based on DPWG guidelines.

The PGx-KB also has the following quoted Purpose:

"To compute patient specific drug selection and dosing recommendations."   

Although it is not very specific, this Purpose meets with our working definition of a Purpose for a KB, which is simply a statement indicating why something exists that may also detail its audience, its intended context and platform for use, its use case(s), and/or its stakeholders.    

The PGx-KB meets all of the requirements of a Knowledge Base type of Knowledge Object or "KB-KO." For more information about the formalized Knowledge Objects (KOs) we work with, see the Knowledge Object Implementation Ontology [here at Github](https://github.com/kgrid/koio) and [here at Bioportal](https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/KOIO).

### Who created the PGx-KB?

The PGx-KB is experimental work of the Knowledge Systems Lab (KSL) at the University of Michigan. For more details about our lab, see [KSL @ U-M](https://knowledge-systems.lab.medicine.umich.edu/).

### Why was the PGx-KB example KB-KO created?

The PGx-KB was created as an **experiement** in building Knowledge Bases by using and extending formal model for all Knowledge Objects, [KOIO 2.1] (https://github.com/kgrid/koio/releases/tag/2.1).

Several more specific motivations for creating the PGx-KB are these:
