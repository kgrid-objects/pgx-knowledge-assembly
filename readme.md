### PGx Knowledgebase (PGx-KB)

## What is the PGx-KB?

The PGx-KB is an example of a distinct Knowledge Object (KO) of the Knowledge Base (KB) type.

By our working definition, a Knowledge Base is defined as a type of Knowledge Object that has one or more Knowledge Sets and has one or more Purposes.

In keeping with this definition, the PGx-KB has the following three Knowledge Sets:

Knowledge Set 1: A list of KOs with implementations of knowledge for mapping genotypes to pharmacogenomic (PGx) phenotypes based on CPIC guidelines.
Knowledge Set 2: A list of KOs with implementations of knowledge for mapping PGx phenotypes to drug-specific recommendations based on CPIC guidelines.
Knowledge Set 3: A list of KOs with implementations of knowledge for mapping PGx phenotypes to drug-specific recommendations based on DPWG guidelines.

The PGx-KB also has the following Purpose:

~~~

The PGx-KB meets all of the requirements of a Knowledge Base type of Knowledge Object or "KB-KO."

## Why was the PGx-KB example of a KB-KO created?

The PGx-KB was created as an experiement in building Knowledge Bases by using and extending formal model for all Knowledge Objects, KOIO 2.1.

Several more specific motivations for creating the PGx-KB are these:
